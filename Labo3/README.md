* School : HE-Arc - Ingénierie (Neuchâtel)

Objectives
----------

The objectives are to make an JavaScript programs which solve a linear system using the Gauss-Jordan
elimination Algorithm to triangulate a matrix.

The matrix must be contained in JSON files.

Method
------

### File reading

Because the using of JavaScript and HTML technology we can't make a direct access to the file system.
So we decide to work with the new (HTML5) JS File API. This API give the access to the files selected
by the user.

### Gauss-Jordan elimination

### Substitution method

Conclusion
----------

This programs finds the solutions of a linear system.
